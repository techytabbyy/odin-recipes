<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nothing beats a warm cookie with a cup of milk. Crunchy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside? Yes!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 and 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
    <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg + 1 egg yolk</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 and 1/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin. Pour into dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and appear greasy. Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
<li>Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2–3 hours.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
<li>Use a cookie scoop to measure dough for cookies and roll into a ball. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
<li>Bake the cookies for 12–13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned.</li>
