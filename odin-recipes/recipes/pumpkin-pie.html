<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The quintessential Thanksgiving dessert best paired with whipped cream.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pie dough</li>
    <li>15-ounce can pumpkin puree</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 and 1/4 cups brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
</ul> 
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 375Â°F.</li>
<li>Par-bake the crust: Line the pie crust with parchment paper. Fill with pie weights or dried beans. Make sure the weights/beans are evenly distributed around the pie dish. Par-bake the crust for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the parchment paper/pie weights. Prick the bottom of the crust all over with a fork to create steam vents and return crust (without weights) to the oven for 7-8 more minutes or until the bottom is *just* starting to brown</li>
<li>Make the pumpkin pie filling: Whisk the pumpkin, 3 eggs, and brown sugar together until combined. Add the cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, heavy cream, and milk. Vigorously whisk until everything is combined.</li>
<li>Pour pumpkin pie filling into the warm crust. Only fill the crust about 3/4 of the way up.</li>
<li>Bake the pie until the center is almost set, about 55-60 minutes give or take. A small part of the center will be wobbly. After 25 minutes of baking, be sure to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil to prevent the edges from getting too brown.</li>
<li>Once done, transfer the pie to a wire rack and allow to cool completely for at least 3 hours before garnishing and serving.</li>
